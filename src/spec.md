# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a simple 3D ghost hunting game where players catch floating ghosts in a spooky environment and track their score.

**Planned changes:**
- Build 3D game environment using Three.js and React Three Fiber with dark, atmospheric lighting and fog
- Implement ghost entities that float and move autonomously around the scene
- Add player interaction to catch ghosts via mouse clicks or keyboard controls
- Create backend score tracking system that persists across sessions
- Display real-time score and game status in UI overlay
- Apply dark horror visual theme with eerie colors and ghostly aesthetic throughout the interface
- Integrate generated ghost sprites and atmospheric background images into the 3D scene

**User-visible outcome:** Players can navigate a spooky 3D environment, catch floating ghosts by clicking on them, and see their score increase with each successful catch. The game maintains a dark, atmospheric horror theme throughout.
