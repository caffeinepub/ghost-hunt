  "summary": "The implementation successfully delivers all core requirements for a 3D ghost hunting game using Three.js and React Three Fiber. The code includes a complete 3D environment with atmospheric lighting and fog (REQ-1), autonomous floating ghost entities (REQ-2), click-based ghost catching mechanics (REQ-3), backend score persistence (REQ-4), real-time UI score display (REQ-5), comprehensive dark horror theming (REQ-6), and asset loading from the generated directory (REQ-7). All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed through the implementation.",
